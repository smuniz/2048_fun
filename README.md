# 2048_fun

Super simple 2048 game solver using Python and some simple code (based on Python
implementation called [term2048](https://github.com/bfontaine/term2048/)

## About the code

<p>Basically all the movements in the next couple of rounds are calculated (yes,
all of them, tons of resources but doable) and the one with more score will be kept.
</p>

<p>The usage of PyPy is recommended; the performance will drascially
enhance.
</p>

<p>Lots of improvements could be done but give that this solution just took one day
to be implemented & tested and works ok then I'm satisfied :-)
</p>
